**Description**

**fly me to the moon** is a 3D-animated application driven by webGL technologies from Cesium and Three.js. It is a client-side app that attempts to provide both a visual and informational experience.

This application uses a large extent of the webGL camera. A user can fly to anywhere on Earth. Or they can select "anywhere but here" and fly to 25-handpicked destinations, many considered the most beautful on our planet. There is also an option to fly home where the user's current location is collected using the Navigator API.

The app also enables various map views and the user can alternate between 3D arial view and 2D terrain view. Upon arrival at any destination, the application enables the user to explore and reset the camera back to a bird's eye view of the globe.

Lastly, **fly me to the moon** enables, well, flying to the moon. Only this aspect of the app does not use the moon's real location. Using Velocity.js animations, the DOM fades to black on scene initiation and provides a tunnel-like effect that gives the user the experience of flying through space. 

The final scene renders a three.js-built sphere wrapped in a NASA Moon Mesh edited in Adobe Photoshop CC to manipluate the texture and match the style of the site and the overall feel of the intended experience.

Moon and other location data is provided upon arrival.
